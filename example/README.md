[Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)](https://www.salesforce.com/) - MobilePush SDK for Flutter.

Marketing Cloud MobilePush lets you create and send notifications to encourage use of your app.

This SFMC Flutter Plugin includes:

* Push Notifications

    Create a message using one of the templates in Marketing Cloud MobilePush or the Push Notification template in Content Builder or Journey Builder.

* In-App Messages

    In-app messages allow you to interact with your mobile app users while they use your mobile app, which is when they are most engaged. Trigger a message to show in your mobile app when a user opens the app on their device. While you can send this message to all of a contact‚Äôs devices, it only shows on the first device that opens the app. In-app messages can‚Äôt be created in MobilePush.

# Let's get started #

First of all you need to add sfmc_plugin in your project. In order to do that, follow [this guide](https://pub.dev/packages/sfmc_plugin/install).

We suggest you to check [example](https://github.com/sefidgaran/salesforce-marketing-cloud/tree/main/src/example) source code.

## Setup Android 
Create an app in MobilePush. This process connects the device to the MobilePush app you created previously in [MobilePush](https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-Android/create-apps/create-apps-overview.html).

Note: The Android SDK requires Android API 21 or greater and has dependencies on the Android Support v4 and Google Play Services libraries.

### Set up Firebase
Follow the [Android Firebase setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) documentation.

#### And your Firebase google-services.json to your android/app folder.

#### Add google-services plugin to your android/app/build.gradle:
```java
  apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

#### Add google-services dependency to android/build.gradle:
```java
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.13'
  }
```
## Initialize SFMC SDK in Android

Please update android/gradle.properties as example below:
```java
MC_APP_ID="<YOUR_SFMC_APP_ID>"
MC_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_SFMC_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
MC_SENDER_ID="<YOUR_FIREBASE_CLOUD_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_FOR_SFMC>"
MC_MID="<YOUR_SFMC_MID>"
MC_SERVER_URL="<YOUR_SFMC_URL>"
```
## Setup iOS 
Please follow the [Provision for Push](https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/get-started/get-started-provision.html).

Note: Please add UIBackgroundModes keys into your info.plist file as below:
###  Provision for Push

```plist
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
    	<string>fetch</string>
    	<string>remote-notification</string>
	</array>
```

### Setup `UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate
Add the following lines to the `application` method in the AppDelegate.m/AppDelegate.swift file of your iOS project.

Objective-C:
```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```

Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```

## Use Flutter Plugin

The first step is initializing the SFMC plugin with credential information (applies to iOS only, for Android please refer to setup Android section). 
[Learn more](https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/get-started/get-started-setupapps.html)

```dart
    /// iOS only
    var isInitialized = await SfmcPlugin().initialize(
        appId: '<YOUR_APP_ID>',
        accessToken: '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>',
        mid: '<YOUR_MID>',
        sfmcURL:
            '<YOUR_SFMC_URL>',
        senderId: '<YOUR_FIREBASE_CLOUD_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>',
        delayRegistration: true);
```

The second step is setting your sfmc contact key which is a unique client id in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

```dart
await SfmcPlugin().setContactKey('<Uniquely Identifying Key>');
```
